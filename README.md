# SearchAndSort

    This is a great program in Java. I create a new file whith the name of the user, then ask for the size 
		of the array than will be created. Then create an unsorted array whith random numbers between 0 and 22.
		(I made the range 23 because is better for the user see the results, but the range can be change to
		any hight number. I am going to do it after show evidence, I will increace the range to 100.) Then, check 
		the array and start to sorted value to value. Then print the unsorted and sorted array,   
		(I did that for improve the vision of the arrays). Then print 4 random numbers
		between 0 and 22 (I can change that too), to compare with all values of the unsorted and sorted array.
		Then, print a messsage each time to show the numbers of serches in each array. At the end show how many 
		serches in total and the average of serches for both arrays. 
		NOTE: The resuls will be display in de comand prompt and in the new file created with the name of the user.
